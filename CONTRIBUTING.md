# Contributing to SoroScan 🔍

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to SoroScan!

SoroScan is an open-source indexing layer designed to make Soroban smart contract data accessible and queryable. Whether you're fixing a bug, improving documentation, or building a new feature, we welcome your involvement.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to SoroScan and its packages.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Find an Issue
* Navigate to the **Issues** tab.
* Filter by `good-first-issue` if you are new to the project.
* **Claim it:** Please comment **"I'd like to work on this!"** on the issue thread to avoid duplicate work. Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you.
* Clone & Navigate after forking the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/soroscan.git
cd soroscan
```

### 2. Environment Setup

This project requires **Rust**, **Python 3.11+**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**.

#### 🐍 Backend (Django) Setup
The backend handles data ingestion, the API, and webhook dispatching.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to backend directory
cd django-backend

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local PostgreSQL credentials

# 5. Run Migrations & Start Server
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

🦀 Smart Contract (Rust) Setup
If you are modifying the core indexing logic or event emission standards.


```bash
# 1. Navigate to contracts directory
cd soroban-contracts/soroscan_core

# 2. Run tests to ensure environment is correct
cargo test

# 3. Build optimized WASM
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### 3. Making Changes

Branching: Create a new branch for your work.

```Bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```
Code Style:

- **Python:** We adhere to PEP 8. Please run black . before committing.

- **Rust:** Please run cargo fmt before committing.


### Database Migrations 
Database migrations are critical for maintaining schema consistency across environments.

#### When to Run `makemigrations`
Run this command **whenever you modify any Django model** in `models.py`:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

This generates a new migration file in `migrations/` that describes the schema changes.

**Important:** Always commit the generated migration file with your PR!

#### When to Run `migrate`
Run this command in these situations:

1. **After pulling changes** from `main` that include new migrations:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **After checking out a PR branch** to test it locally:
   ```bash
   gh pr checkout 123  # or git checkout feature-branch
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **After generating new migrations** yourself:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

#### Checking Migration Status
To see which migrations are applied or pending:

```bash
python manage.py showmigrations
```

Migrations with `[X]` are applied, `[ ]` are pending.

#### PR Requirements
If your PR modifies models:
- ✅ Include the generated migration file(s)
- ✅ Ensure `python manage.py migrate` runs without errors
- ✅ Run tests after migrating to verify compatibility

### 4. Testing
We prioritize stability. **Please run the test suite before submitting your PR.**

Django Tests:

```Bash
python manage.py test
```
Contract Tests:

```Bash
cargo test
```
Linting:
```Bash=# Python
ruff check .
black --check .

# Rust
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

## 🚀 Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
